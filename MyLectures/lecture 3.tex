	\section{Introduction}
	Graph coloring is a method to assign colors to the vertices of a graph \(G\) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Graph coloring is a special case of graph labeling; it is an assignment of labels traditionally called "colors" to vertices of a graph \(G\).
	
	\section{Basic Concepts}
	
	\subsection{Vertex Coloring}
	The assignment of labels, called colors, to vertices of a graph \(G\) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color is called a vertex coloring.
	
	\begin{definition}
		A \textit{vertex coloring} is an assignment of labels (or colors) to the vertices of a graph \(G\) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
	\end{definition}
	
	\subsection{Edge Coloring}
	An edge coloring of a graph is a coloring of the edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.
	
	\begin{definition}
		An \textit{edge coloring} is an assignment of labels (or colors) to the edges of a graph \(G\) such that no two adjacent edges have the same color.
	\end{definition}
	
\subsection{Chromatic Number}
The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of \(G\) so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

\begin{definition}
	The \textit{chromatic number} of a graph \(G\), denoted \(\chi(G)\), is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of \(G\) so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Chromatic Index}
The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the edges of \(G\) so that no two adjacent edges share the same color.

\begin{definition}
	The \textit{chromatic index} of a graph \(G\), denoted \(\chi'(G)\), is the smallest number of colors needed to color the edges of \(G\) so that no two adjacent edges share the same color.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Coloring Algorithms}
There are several algorithms that can produce a coloring of a graph, either as an exact solution, or as an approximation for NP-hard problems.

\begin{definition}
	A \textit{coloring algorithm} is an algorithm that assigns labels (traditionally called "colors") to the vertices of a graph \(G\) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Greedy Coloring}
Greedy coloring is a simple coloring algorithm that assigns colors to vertices one by one, choosing the smallest available color.

\begin{definition}
	\textit{Greedy coloring} is a coloring method that colors vertices one by one, assigning each vertex the smallest available color.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Welsh-Powell Algorithm}
The Welsh-Powell algorithm is an efficient algorithm to color a graph, based on greedy coloring.

\begin{definition}
	The \textit{Welsh-Powell algorithm} is a modification of the greedy coloring algorithm where the ordering of the vertices to be colored is done by non-increasing degrees.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Four Color Theorem}
The four color theorem states that any map in a plane can be colored using four-colors in such a way that regions sharing a common boundary (other than a single point) do not share the same color.

\begin{theorem}
	\textbf{Four Color Theorem}: Every planar graph can be colored with at most four colors.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Five Color Theorem}
The five color theorem is a result from graph theory that given a plane separated into regions, such as a political map of the counties of a state, the regions may be colored using no more than five colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions receive the same color.

\begin{theorem}
	\textbf{Five Color Theorem}: Every planar graph can be colored with at most five colors.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Coloring and Chromatic Polynomials}
The chromatic polynomial counts the number of ways a graph can be colored.

\begin{definition}
	The \textit{chromatic polynomial} \(P_G(k)\) of a graph \(G\) is a polynomial that counts the number of proper colorings of \(G\) with exactly \(k\) colors.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Graph Coloring Applications}
Graph coloring is used in a variety of practical applications, from scheduling to register allocation.

\begin{definition}
	\textit{Graph coloring applications}: Graph coloring is used in a variety of applications, including scheduling (assigning tasks to workers), frequency assignment (assigning frequencies to radio stations), and register allocation (assigning registers to variables in computer science).
\end{definition}

\subsection{Perfect Graphs}
A perfect graph is a graph in which the chromatic number of every induced subgraph equals the size of the largest clique of that subgraph.

\begin{definition}
	A \textit{perfect graph} is a graph in which the chromatic number of every induced subgraph equals the order of the largest clique of that subgraph.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Graph Coloring Problems}
Graph coloring problems include determining the chromatic number or chromatic index of a graph, or determining whether a graph can be colored in a certain way.

\begin{definition}
	\textit{Graph coloring problems} are computational problems associated with coloring the vertices or edges of a graph in certain ways, often with constraints on the colors of adjacent vertices or edges.
\end{definition}

\section{Conclusion}
